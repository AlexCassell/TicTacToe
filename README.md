# Basic Tic Tac Toe

Who gets to go first is now random.  Still unbeatable as far as I can tell. I once read that it takes 15 hours to program the AI for Tic Tac Toe and I thought that was crazy.  It took me 5 hours to program the entire game, including a long lunch break and a screaming toddler.

About 6 hours once the backend and stats were added.

# Basic Tic Tac Toe


Someone told me that it takes 15 hours to write the AI for Tic Tac Toe and I wanted to see if that could possibly be true.  It took me 5 hours to build the game, and another hour to add the stats and backend.  This code needs to be refactored, because it could be done with less code but this was just an exercise so I doubt I will mess with it anymore after today.

This has not been tested on mobile.. though should be playable if your phone is in landscape mode.
